# Resumatrix

Main branch publishes to: https://dgf1979.github.io/resumatrix/

A personal project with the goal of creating an 'about me' blog/history archive that can serve as a resume extension - both for self-reference and for potential interviewers who, (like myself,) might appreciate additional optional context beyond what the "one page and a cover" format can provide.

## Project Goals

- Reproduce my complete work history/resume for reference (in content, but not necessarily format.)
- Provide additional resume details that may not 'make the cut' of the 1-page format.
- Provide a resource for interviewers who (if they are like me,) would appreciate a low-pressure means of obtaining more information prior to e.g. a live, in-person interview.

## Technical goals

- Low (or no) cost
- Low complexity/easy to update/maintain
- Reasonably portable
- Hand written by me (because while it might be entirely reasonable from a cost/benefit perspective to use an existing platform, I would find it slightly ironic to interview someone claiming to be a web developer who then directed me to their personal site built on e.g. SquareSpace).

## Stretch goals

- Host with my own domain (more professional & portable)
- No build step (simpler, at least initially)
- Static site (more flexibility RE: low-cost hosting)
- Some sort of filtering/search mechanism so visitors can quickly home in on topics of interest
- A resume-builder mode mode so I can quickly assemble a customized, print-friendly resume using the site
